# SJGL
SJGL is a software rasterization library for Java. It can rasterize triangles and interpolate attributes, such as vectors for the respective vertices. With the built-in shader system, you can use both vertex and fragment shaders. The main goal is to make it easy for beginners to dive into 3D rasterization.
